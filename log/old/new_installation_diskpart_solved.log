Using tutorial : https://www.debugpoint.com/2020/12/xfce-arch-linux-install-4-16/

In Machine 1:
    start the machine
    when prompted choose the first option
    when bootup finished (you should see the line root@archiso ~ # <root is in red>)
    enter: ping google.com
    once you see that content is beng recieved, you can hit |lft CTRL] + C to stop the command.
        A packet loosk like this:
            64 byte from par21s19-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.179.78): icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=5.74 ms
    this allows you to check your connectivity
    enter : show the keyboard options: ls /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/**/*.map.gz
        to display the availble keyboards if you do not know the keyboard you want and that quwerty does not suit you.
    add : | less to break the list to the size of your terminal.
    enter : loadkeys fr-latin1 to change the keyboard layout
    fr is the country of the layout

    Tip: if you are lost while typing, you can pull up an image on your phone of a qwerty keyboard to help you out.
    Tip 2: If the screen is to crowded, enter clear to clean it
    Make sure the system clock is accurate: timedatectl set-ntp true
    Display the current clock info: timedatectl status
    If the timezone is incorrect, and you don't know the code for your country, enter : timedatectl list-timezones
        Type Q to exit
    The generic command to set the time is: timedatectl set-timezone Time/Zone
    for me it is:
        timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Paris
    enter: timedatectl to display clock info
    Available drives:
        list available drives: fdisk -l
    Partition drive:
        description:
            CL = The default prompt to ask for help or other things
            PT = partition type
            PN = Partition number
            FS = First sector
            LS = Last sector
            CR = Messages saying that partitions were sucessefully created.
            TP: Change the partition type (extended, swap (physical temp memory area), ext4, ext2) this is the t letter to be entered in front of "Command (m for help);"
            TPC: TP code (L = list types, ext = 05, swap = 82)
            TPM: TP message

        CL: w
        cfdisk /dev/sda
        Under the text "/dev/sda1" is text "Free space"
        press the [DOWN arrow] key to create a new partition (The reason is that the "[   New   ]" should also be higlighted, if not use the [LEFT Arrows]/[RIGHT Arrows] to change selected option)
        The previous place where the "[   New   ]" label was will shift to "Partitiion size: 17G"
        Write "400M" instead of "17G"
        Press the [ENTER key]
        Press the [DOWN arrow] to go to the "Free space" section
        Make sure that the text "[   New   ]" is highlited, if not (use the [LEFT key] or [RIGHT key] to higlight it)
        Press the [ENTER key]
        Write "9G" instead of "16.6G"
        Press the [ENTER key]
        Press the [DOWN arrow] to go to the "Free space" section
        Make sure that the text "[   New   ]" is highlited, if not (use the [LEFT key] or [RIGHT key] to higlight it)
        Press the [ENTER key]
        Write "500M" instead of "7.6G"
        Press the [ENTER key]
        Press the [DOWN arrow] to go to the "Free space" section
        Make sure that the text "[   New   ]" is highlited, if not (use the [LEFT key] or [RIGHT key] to higlight it)
        Press the [ENTER key]
        Write "5G" instead of "7.1G"
        Press the [ENTER key]
        Now, we are going to apply our changes
        At the bottom of the screen there should be 8 labels, ("[Bootable]", "[ Delete ]", "[ Resize ]", "[  Quit  ]", "[  Type  ]", "[  Help  ]", "[  Write  ]", "[   Dump   ]")
        Use the [LEFT key]/[RIGHT key] to navigat to the "[ Write ]" option, this will apply the changes we made.
        Once on it, press the [ENTER key]
        Type "yes"
        Press the [ENTER key]
        Use the [LEFT key]/[RIGHT key] to navigat to the "[ Quit ]" option, this will exit cfdisk.

    list the disks: fdisk -l
    formating the disks to the Appropriate format
    mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda6 //"root" sda2
    mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda8 //"home" sda4

    mkswap /dev/sda3 | mkswap /dev/sda7 | swapon /dev/sda3 */
    mount the disks:
    mount /dev/sda6 /mnt
    mkdir /mnt/boot /mnt/var /mnt/home
    mount /dev/sda5 /mnt/boot
    Installing arch_linux:
        pacman -Syy
        pacstrap /mnt base base-devel linux linux-firmware nano emacs dhcpcd net-tools grub
    Gnerating a table system:
        genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
    setting up the base system:
        arch-chroot /mnt
        nano /etc/locale.gen
        commeted (if wasn't) en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 
        uncommented fr_FR.UTF-8 UTF-8
        uncommented fr_FR@euro ISO-8SO-8859-15
    left  ctrl + s
    left  ctrl + x
    generating keymap:
        locale-gen
    setting up langage:
        echo LANG=en_GB.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf
        export LANG=fr_FR.UTF-8
    setting the keyboard layout (this is for arch):
        echo KEYMAP=fr > /etc/vconsole.conf

    setting up the Hardware clock:
        hwclock --systohc --utc
    setting up the username:
        echo my_client_<your_name>-pc > /etc/hostname
        In my case:
            echo my_client_henryletellier-pc > /etc/hostname
    enabling the dhcpcd:
        systemctl enable dhcpcd
    setting up the root account:
        passwd root (this is the password setter for the root account)
    adding a new user:
        useradd -m -g users -G wheel -s /bin/bash <account_name>
    setting the passwd:
        passwd <the_account_on_wich_you_wish_to_set_the_password>
        in my case:
            /*useradd -m -g users -G wheel -s /bin/bash test
            passwd test*/
            useradd -m -g users -G wheel -s /bin/bash romain
            passwd romain
            useradd -m -g users -G wheel -s /bin/bash henry
            passwd henry
            useradd -m -g users -G wheel -s /bin/bash leslie
            passwd leslie
    To add a user with full rights:
        create an account:

                    write on a new line
                    <account_name> ALL=(ALL) ALL
                in my case:
                    (just under the line: root ALL=(ALL) ALL)
                    romain ALL=(ALL) ALL
                    henry ALL=(ALL) ALL
    How to show the existing accounts:
        cat /etc/passwd | less

    Installing grub:
        grub-install /dev/sda
        If it refuses to install:
            grub-install /dev/sda --force
        grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
        mkinitcpio -p linux
        exit
    preparing for reboot:
        umount /mnt/boot
        umount /mnt
    rebooting:
        reboot

    Intermediate part: lets fix  few issues
        logged in with the root account
        I don't know why, but generally, when the machine boots up, the default keyboard stays US and has not changed to FR
            go to your account
                go into your bashrc
                    add at the bottom of the file:
                        sudo loadkeys fr-latin1
                        add a new line
                        save [left CTRL] + S
                        exit [left CTRL] + X
        Changing the langage from french to english:
            select the langage from the list:
                sudo nano /etc/locale.gen
            generate a new lngge with:
                sudo locale-gen
                    Uncomment the langage you wish
                        I uncommented en_GB.UTF-8 UTF-8
            reboot
                
    
    Part 2: installing XFCe in archinux
        logged in with the root account.
        Installing Xorg:
            sudo pacman -S --needed xorg
        Installing additional components and applications
            sudo pacman -S --needed xfce4 mousepad parole ristretto thunar-archive-plugin thunar-media-tags-plugin xfce4-battery-plugin xfce4-datetime-plugin xfce4-mount-plugin xfce4-netload-plugin xfce4-notifyd xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin xfce4-screensaver xfce4-taskmanager xfce4-wavelan-plugin xfce4-weather-plugin xfce4-whiskermenu-plugin xfce4-xkb-plugin file-roller network-manager-applet leafpad epdfview galculator lightdm lightdm-gtk-greeter lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings capitaine-cursors arc-gtk-theme xdg-user-dirs-gtk
        Installing goodies because it could contain stuff that we did not install
            sudo pacman -S --needed xfce4-goodies
                There was more interresting stuff
        Installing some compatibility helpers for communication between virtualbox and the computer
            sudo pacman -S --needed virtualbox-guest-utils xf86-video-vmware
        Enabeling the display manager and network manager as service so that they run on next login:
            systemctl enable lightdm
            systemctl enable NetworkManager
        rebooting the system to apply changes:
            reboot
        For further requirements, run the config_users_env.sh in an adccount that has the same rights as root (a sudoer) but that is not root.
    At this moment it is required to power off the machine.

    How to make/import a safe copy of your virtual system :
    It is recommended to (if using a virtual machine) to export a copy of your machine (for virtualbox it will be in the ova form and can be found when clicking on (Tools icon) Tools --> Export)
        In the new window, choosing your virtual machine
        clicking next
        checking the box Include ISO image files
            This will ensure that it can do a rollback more easally if needed.
        clicking next
        possibly adding info in the sections of the next window
        and then clicking the export button.
        wait for it to export and you now have a copy of your virtual machine
    To import an instance of a machine, (if in virtualbox) it is going to (Tools icon) Tools --> import
        In the window that just opened clicking the brown folder with a green arrow
        clicking next
        possibly checking the info on the next screen
        clicking import
        wait for it to import and you now have loaded into virtualbox an instance of your saved system.

    Intermediate part , setting up Debian iso for boot:
        go to Storage:
        In Controller: IDE:
            remove the current iso (into the iso)
        click on the disk with a +
        in the new window
        click the disk with add to load a new iso (the debian one)
        once the iso is loaded, go back to System
            In Boot Order:
                move (Optical above Hard Disk)
                then close the settings window by clicking the ok button
        Once done, start the VM, by clicking on the green arrow

    /*Part 3:
        Intalling debian as a dualboot (but it was using graphics, so forget this part)
            On the first boot up screen, choose the graphical install option
            On the second window choose the langage of the debian system
                For me it will be French
                                with an azerty keyboard
            On the next window, you will choose your geographical location
                For the excersize it will be Shanghai
                    For this, choose the option "Autre", click "Continuer"
                    Then, choose "Asie", click "Continuer"
                    Then, choose "Chine", click "Continuer"
            This will lead the Debian software to ask you the keyboard character set.
                For this excersize I will choose fr_FR.UTF-8
            Then it will ask the keyboard layout.
                For this excersize I will use "Français"
            Let it do its work
            The next window will ask for the name of the computer
                For the excersize I will leave it as is.
            Next The system will demand the domain name
                I will use: */
    Part 3 Debian (The non graphical installation version)
        When booting the machine, choose the second option (The text is "Install")
        This will lead you to an old-like window display (grey background on a blue border background)
        On the main screen choose the french langage
        On the second screen set your geographical location
            If you are doing the epitech boot, choose "Autre"
                The next window will ask for more detail on the the continent you are in (Africa, Asia, Europe, Indian ocean, etc)
                For epitech, we will choose "Asie"
                The next screen will display the coutrys of the given continent.
                For epitech, we will choose "Chine"
            else:
                go to the next step
        If the system was unable to locate the keyboard charset, the next window will ask you for it
            For epitech we will choose: fr_FR.UTF-8
            In this context, the next window will ask for the keyboard layout,
            For epitech we will use "Français"
        The next series of windows will be Debian setting up its info
        The next window of interest will be Debian asking for our computer name
            You can give it the name you wish, but for Epitech I will set it to my-client-<your-name>
        The next window will be Debian asking for a domain name:
            You can name it as you wish, but for Epitech I will set it to my-client-<your-name>.<a_domain_name>
                In my case it will be my-client-<your-name>.com
        The next window is a prompt asking you to set the password for the root.
        below the entry line there is a checkbox accompagned with the text "Afficher le mot de passe en clair"
        once done, you can hiw the |DOWN ARROW KEY] until the text "<continuer>" is highited in red
        The following window, will ask you to confirm the entered password of the previous window.
        [KEY WORD]: 
            "compte utilisateur" : display name of the account (requires a name),
            "Identifiant": account (different from the previous word) and can only contain lowercases and numbers,
            "mot de passe": Password

        The following window will as you to create a user account, 
            feel free to name it as you wish, I will name it with <my_name>
            once done, press the [ENTER] key
        The next window will be the "Identifiant" that will be the name displayed on the login page and in software
            For epitech, for the henry_letellier account it will be hl.
        Once these two steps out of the way, create your password for the account that you have just created
        Then confirm that password in the newt window

        After a bit more pf auto configuration by debian in the next window

        The next window will be very important for the dualboot because it is about disk allocation
            as we wich to install Debian alongside arch, we will choose the option "Manuel"
        The next window will ask us how we wich to fragment the disk in order to install Debian alongside Arch
        For this I will choose "Partitionnement assisté"
        Then I will use "Assisté - utiliser le plus grand espace disponible"
        In the next window of options I will choose the "Tout dans une partitio 'recommandé pour les débutants)"
        After a bit of work, the next window will display the partitions after the changes have been loaded (but not applied)
        The debian disk should appear like this 'n° 2  primaire  21.6 GB f ext4 /' it should be the last one in the list of disks, all the others should be the ones on wich arch linux has been installed.
        Navigate to the "Terminer le partitionnement et appliquer les changements"

        The next window will ask us to confirm that we wish to apply the changes to the disk.
            Use the arrows to get to the "<Oui>" button.
        
        Let it do its work
        
        The next window will ask us if we wish it to annalyse if other systems are installed on the drive, and if it should adapt to the launcher
            For this window we will choose "<oui>"
        The next window will inform us that that label has already been analised
            For this we will choose the "<Non>" option to inform the system that we have annalised all the other disks that needed to be annalysed.
        
        The next window will ask us for our geographical location to know wich paquet manager to use.
            In that case, we will choose France (because that is where I am based and running the installation)
                Then, in the next window, we will choose the by default option that is "deb.debian.org"
        If you wish to use a proxy, this is what you can configure in this next window
            In my case I will not be using it.
                So I will leave the field empty and click continue.
        
        Let debian do it's work until the next question window
        
        The next window will be debian asking us if it can anonymously gather information on our paquet download and send it to https://popcon.debian.org/
            Feel free to choose the option you like
                However, if you wish to change your choice later on, you can run the 'dpkg-reconfigure' or 'popularity-contest' or 'dpkg-reconfigure popularity-contest'
        
        Let it run until the next window

        This window will be able to choose different system installation
            for this I will choose (the default because I do not know how to select a checkbox in this graphical version)
                To wich I will add (using the spacebar to select checkboxes):
                    * Cinamon
                    * serveur ssh
            Once you have made your choice, you can hit the enter key to confirm your choice
        
        Let it do its job until the next window
        
        After a while, the next promp is going to ask us if we would like to add Debian to the boot manager in the startup screen.
            For the security, I will risk the "<oui>" button.
            (ignore this line) if the boot screen changes from arch to debian, I will choose the "<non>" option
        The next window, will ask us where we wish to install this program
            For this one we will choose the "/dev/sda ([...])" option, (the '[...]' correspond to it's ID to wich I chose not to copy)
        
        Let it work until we get to the next window

        The next window is a question about the time and how we wish to configure it
            For this we will choose the "<oui>" option
        
        Now, the installation is complete, we will thus, edject our iso image, then reboot
            For people using virtualbox, it has automaticaly been edjected.

        let it run.
        once rebooted, you are free to choose the system you wish to boot on.

        If you chose to boot on debian, click on your account
            Then locate the small cog on the bottom right of the screen
                In the option menu choose Cinamon

    Part 4: Setting the boot menu back to its original state
        Open the settings of your virtual machine
        load the iso of arch-linux
        start the machine
        Once the machine has booted, enter loadkeys fr-latin1 to set the keyboard to azerty
        fdisk /dev/sda
        The description of the partition drive is the same as the partition drive higher up (step 1 (installing arch))
        CL: a
        PN: 5
        CR: "The bootable flag on partition 5 is enabled now."
        CL: a
        PN: 2
        CR: "The bootable flag on partition 2 is disabled now."
        CL: w
        you can now reboot the machine by typing reboot
        

Will restart installation but with a different disk allocation.
I will follow this tutorial to see how he does and addapt the installation:

In Machine 2:
    When launched, let it do its thing and get ready
    as no specifications on how to use the installer has been given, I will then proceed the normal wayn the way you are expected to use it
    So, once the system installer has booted up it will display a series of langages.
    As there are no requirements for the langage to be usedn I will therefore use english (UK)
        feel free to use any langage that pleases you, but all my instructions will contain the english names
    Once the langage selected, the next window (if an update is available (wich is my case)) the window will offer you the choice of updateing the installer,  continuing without updating or to go back)
        I will update the installer, newer = better (often)
        please note that for this update, the system will need an access to the internet
    after a bit of work, the system reboots and prompts us with two scroll-down menus:
        The first one is for the keybord layout wich for me is french
        The second one is the variant (AZERTY, QWERTY, etc) which for me is French - French (AZERTY)
        If you are to lazy to search the scroll-downs, there is an option wich is [identify keyboard]
        Once your choice done, go to the done option (bottom of screen) and press enter
        after a bit of work
        the installer wll prompt us with the connection page, wich in a VM will be eth (short for ethernet)
            It will also show you your DHCPV4 whichi is the id of your server (not the IP), basicaly it is a door to allow other computers to connect to it.
        If lost, you always have the shell access of the ssh help to guide you a bit throug your actions.
        Meanwhile, I will go find a tutorial to beeter understand how to make the good connections
        and opn the right ports.
