                        Method to add an iso:
                               click on the cd with a + (located next to the text "Controller: IDE"
                               In the windw that just opened click the disk icon with a + (text bellow the icon "Add")
                               In the new pop-up, locate your iso image, click on it, then click the open button on the top right of the window
                               in the previous window "<name_of_your_wm> - Optical Disk Selector" click the "Choose" button (bottom right)
                               back in the "Settings" window, you should now see a new disk appear with the name of the iso file on it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We have now left the settings page by clicking ok (bottom right of the page)
click the start button (green arrow, top of the vm info display)
Reading a few of the messages that appeared in the vm window
for this, pressed the ctrl key on the right the the "p" key (pause the machine)
read the messages
did right key ctrl+p
chose the first option of the boot menu of archlinuxes installation screen
let it start up: waited for it to display :
    Arch Linux 5.15.12-arch1-1 (tty1)  <that is my version, it may very depending on your iso>
    \n
    archiso login: root (automatic login)

Went to the Archlinux installation guide: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide
Read the guide
-    need to know how to do for epitech project:
while reading the epitech pdf, realised that I got a few things wrong, so
I turned off Archlinux: (command: "sudo systemctl poweroff")
!!!!!! Remember, your keyboar is a querty in the default boot up of archlinux !!!!!!!!!

When the system has powerd off
open the settings panel:
in:
    General
        Name: change "arch_linux" to "B2_Boot1"
    System
        Base Memory: 1000 MB (or 1GB)
    Storage
        Controller: SATA
                    click on the hard_drive logo with the name "arch_linux.vdi"
                    click the remove button (when hovered displays: Remove selected Storage attachment)
                    Now click the hard drive logo with a + on it (it is next to the Controller: SATA (disk image with a +))
                    In the new window, click the hard drive with a circle on it and the text "Create" under it
                    In the new window choose:
                       VDI for the disk file type
                       click next
                       Dynamically allocated for the storage on the physical hard disk
                       click next
                       you can leave the path as is
                       "${HOME}/VirtualBox VMs/arch_linux/arch_linux_1.vdi"
                       of change it to:
                       "${HOME}/VirtualBox VMs/arch_linux/B2_Boot1.vdi"
                       <the ${HOME} is just a way for me to make the path esier to understand, in the window it will be the full path starting from your root "/">
                       For the size of the hard disk (slider bellow the path) change it from 8 to 10GB
                       click create
                       once back in the Hard Disk Selector, your disk (of 10.00GB) should be located under the Not Attached section, select it
                       click the choose button on the bottom right of the window                       
you can now click ok on the bottom right of the settings page
You can now start arch linux with the start button
in the boot menu, choose the first option
wait for it to finish booting and to display the basic greeting message accompanied by "root@archiso ~ #" prompt, <root being in red>

/!\ When you are in this mode, nothing is saved for the moment so if you boot off archlinux, everything will be lost /!\
This is usefull if you messed up

Before looking at the epitech requirements, lets configure a few things to ease the installation process
the following commands can be found in the arch linux installation guide:
Tip: To help you type if your keyboard is non qwerty, pull up a an image of a qwerty keyboard layout on your phone, this could help you locate the required letters.

Tip 2: if ever you misspell a command, press the up arrow key to call back the last command and use the left and right arrows to move through it.

keyboard: (going from quwerty to azerty)
          loadkeys fr-latin1 (for the french azrty layout)
          for other azerty layouts type:
          loadkeys <you_country_name_abreviation(fr,de,it, etc>-latin1
wifi:    (connect your wifi)
         try:
            ping google.com
            if packets a being recieved then, you are connected to the internet
            to cut the ping do: left key ctrl+c
            PS: a paquet reception looks like this: 64 bytes from par21s04-in-f14.1e100.net (216.58.213.174): icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=4.04 ms
            a paquet should take less than a second to be displayed
            if your are not sure that you are receiving pakets, try ping google.com (or ping <another_websites_domain>) on your computer (not the vm)
         if this failes:
            run : ip link
            then try to ping again
         if this failes, refer to the wiki (ip-link(8)): https://man.archlinux.org/man/ip-link.8
         PS: in a vm, for internet to work, your computer running the vm must be connected to the internet

update the system clock:
       to check the current clock info, type: timedatectl
       if your clock is not up to date, use man timedatectl (for now)
       timedatectl set-ntp true

usefull to know:
list recognised disks:
     fdisk -l
Before we enter the epitech requirements, lets just try to install arch using this tutorial (from 4:09 :  https://youtu.be/PQgyW10xD8s)
command 1:
    show the keyboard options: ls /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/**/*.map.gz
command 2: 
    show the same thing, but break the content down to the size of the terminal:
        ls /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/**/*.map.gz | less
command 3:
    load a different keyboard layout:
        loadkeys fr-latin1
command 4:
    clearing the screen:
        clear
command 5:
    Make sure internet is up and running:
        ping google.com
command 6:
    Kill the ping:
        left ctrl + c
command 7:
    make sure the system clock is accurate:
        timedatectl set-ntp true
command 8:
    checkin the cuurrent system clock info:
        timedatectl status
command 9:
    listing all available drives:
        fdisk -l
command 10:
    creating a disk:
        fdisk /dev/sda 
command 10.1:
    asking for help in the fdisk command:
        in the prompt: "Command (m for help):" m
command 10.2:
    creating a gpt partition:
        in the prompt "Command (m for help):" g
    But epitech wants a dos partition so we will type o instead of g.
command 10.3:
    asking for help again:
        in the prompt "Command (m for help):" m
command 10.4:
    adding a new parition:
        in the prompt "Command (m for help):" n
command 10.4.1:
    detailing the info for the parition:
        this is if you followed the g command:
            in the prompt "Parition number (1-128, default 1):"  1
            in the prompt "First sector ([...], default [...]):" [ENTER key]
            in the propmpt "Last sector, +/~sectors or +/~size[...], default [...]):" +550M
        this is if you followed the o command:
            # This current setup is almost right, except that root is an ext4 and that home is at the end, so, these ifs will remain as examples of the process.
            There are two different options for the root and the home partitions, either primary (p) (once done, cannot be split, 3 primary partitionnings will still be available) or extended (e) (unlimited, can be repartitionned later on)
                personnally I will make the root a primary and the home an extended, because we will do a lot more in the home than the root.
                If you choose p:
                    you will then need to asign it to a number (in my case it will be 1)
                    this will be done in the "Partition number (1-4, default 1):" 1
                    then in the question "First sector (2048-[...], default 2048):" [ENTER key]
                    then in the question "Last sector, +/~sectors or +/size{K,M,G,T,P} (2048-[...], default [...]):" +5G
                    once done, the line should be: "Created a new parition 1 of type 'Linux' and of size 5GiB"
                If you choose e:
                    you will then need to assign it to a number (in my case it will be 2)
                    this will be done in the "Partition number (2-4, default 2):" 2
                    then in the question "First sector (10487808-[...], default 10487808):" [ENTER key]
                    then in the question "Last sector, +/~sector or +/~size{K,M,G,T,P} (10487808-[...], default [...]):"+4G
                    once done, the line should be: "Created a new partition 2 of type extended and of size 4 GiB"

                Info: It looks like you can do a maximum of 4 paritions in the current setup.
            # Here is the correct setup, no ifs this time, just input lines
            legend:
                CL = The default prompt to ask for help or other things
                PT = partition type
                PN = Partition number

                LS = Last sector
                CR = Messages saying that partitions were sucessefully created.
            if you followed the two ifs up there:
                CL: d
                PN (1,2) <these are the 2 partitions we had created>: 1
                CR: "Partition 1 has been deleted"
                CL: d
                PN displays "Selected partition 2" (because there are no other partitions, otherwise it would of prompted us)
                CR: "Partiton 2 has been deleted"
                TP: Change the partition type (extended, swap (physical temp memory area), ext4, ext2) this is the t letter to be entered in front of "Command (m for help);"

                TPM: TP message
            if you did not follow the two ifs up there or used the first if to do a rollback (revert the changes you made)

                TPC: 05*/
            To try to solve the problem, looking at the man of fdisk.

            Tip: If ever you mess up, in the default menu ("Command (m for help):") type o to create a new dos table, thus overiting any previous table that was present.
            Tip 2: If you enter into the menu of an option you did not wish to (d for example (to remove a partition)) just press the left key ctrl+c
                    /!\ If you entered into the expert mode per accident, (the x option) your only way out is to enter (the r option) to in the line "Epert command (m for help):" to return to the previous menu.

            once you are satisfied with your choices, you can enter w to save your changes, otherwise enter q to exit without changing the disk.
            if you used w, you will recieve this message: 
                "The partition table has been altered."
                "Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table."
                "Syncing disks"
            The tutorial video now ends (for the moment, I am now following: https://linuxhint.com/use-fdisk-format-partition/) to properly partition the disk, if you have not used the DOS formatting, feel free to continue the video but for you, I think that this tutorial ends here.
following The website for those who have used the DOS formatting (Required by epitech):
    we will now work on partition 1:
        for this follow the following commands:

        pacman -S reflector
            you will see more text appear on screen, (to lazy to copy it, just check the webiste under "Step 10: Check the Mirror List for an Appropriate Mirror").

command 16:
    create a backup of the mirror list
        cp /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.bak

command 17:
    Using the reflector to update the mirror list
        reflector -c "FR" -f 12 -l 10 -n 12 --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
        "FR" is the code of your country
            The will be no ouput this command (this is if everything whent smoothly)

        if you do not know your current timezone code, you can enter:
            timedatectl list-timezones
            Tip: press the Q letter to exit the scroll-down list
        once you have identified your code, you can type:
            timedatectl set-timezone Time/Zone
            for me it is:
                timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Paris
command 21:
    set the locale:
        The locale.gen file contains a list of all available locales. Open it and find the name of your preferred locale:

                The build of a line:
                    if I take #br_FR.UTF-8
                              ||  |  |_ corresponds to the norm of the table
                              ||  |_ corresponds to the country
                              ||_ corresponds to the language
                              |_ is the symbol of the comment
                    if I take #br_FR@euro ISO-8859-1
                              | | | | |   |_ corresponds to the norm of the table
                              | | | | |_ means that a specific part of the langage is taken into account (here the currency)
                              | | | |_ means that it deals with a specific part of the language
                              | | |_ corresponds to the coutry
                              | |_ corresponds to the language
                              |_ is the symbol 
            for me it will be:
                uncommented en_GB.UTF-8 UTF-8
                commeted  en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
                uncommented fr_FR.UTF-8 UTF-8
